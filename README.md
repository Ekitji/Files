## LOLDriverScanner
Download the LOLDriverScanner script and download the drivers.json file (link above, sorry no webrequest included, dont like pwsh talking to internet =] )
Correct the path "$loldriversFilePath" in the powershell script to the location of your drivers.json

Run the script and check the results in console or GridView (excel look-a-like)

Special thanks to:
